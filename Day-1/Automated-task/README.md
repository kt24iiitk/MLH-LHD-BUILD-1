## Inspiration
When we travel abroad and always feel the urge to convert the currency to evaluate our future expenditure, be it during shopping or eating in an expensive restaurant. So to evaluate this quickly we could run a currency exchange python script on our mobile phones or PC instead of googling, especially useful when we don't have access to the internet or to not get distracted by Google.
## What it does
Converts foreign currency to any currency via your terminal
## How we built it
Using Python
