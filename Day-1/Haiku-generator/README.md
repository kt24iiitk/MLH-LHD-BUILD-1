## Inspiration
NLP
## What it does
Generates a Haiku from any piece of Text
eg:-A piece of text `I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces.` generates a haiku :- <br>
*full extent to wipe <br>
unholy retribution <br>
to its full extent* 
## How we built it
Using *spaCy*, which does "Rule-Based Pattern Match" to process texts and *syllapy* to count syllables. 
## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Understood the logic of random Haiku generation and was able to implement an Haiku NLP
## What we learned
