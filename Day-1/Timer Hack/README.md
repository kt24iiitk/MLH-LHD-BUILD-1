## Inspiration
The ever-present need for time management as a student.
## What it does
The Pomodoro Method is a studied and proven method to increase productivity amongst students and working professionals. One works in bursts of 25 ( or 50 minutes) and then takes a short break.
This timer shows how many minutes you have left on its display, and will alert you whenever the time is up.
It also keeps track of your break time.
## How we built it
This timer is built on an Arduino UNO, using a 16x2 Hitachi-compatible LCD display and a piezo buzzer. Plus a lot of wires.
The device was simulated on TinkerCAD.
## What we learned
Figuring out timers and interrupts on Arduino, delay() and millis()  functions.
## What's next for Timer Hack
Interfacing an ultra-sonic sensor to detect whether you're in your seat.
Adding an override "timer-freeze" button.
