## Inspiration
A JSON server database system
## What it does
The Resolute App provides you a real-time web application, that display your "Left to do Resolutions" every time you open your application. The App is made to store your resolutions in a "db.json" file (A pseduo NoSQL Database on your local system) and so it is fetched every time you open the Application and when a resolution is added or when a resolution is completed. 
To Run this app, follow these steps: <br>
`npm install` -> to install all dependencies <br>
`npm run server` ->  to run the db.json file on the server for realtime changes <br>
`npm start` -> to start the application
